Partner dependency and attachment styles
========================================

.. _opening:

The adult attachment theory argues that human beings are biologically dependent on their
partners due to evolutionary benefits.

Although our culture scorns person's need to intimacy, closeness and especially dependency.
It goes up to the point where psychologists think that if you are dependent and especially
addicted, then something is very wrong with you.

On top of that, the relationship rarely come easy for the partners. People seem to struggle
matching their tempers, comfortable degree of intimacy and togetherness.

The theory explains our troubles by explaining our behaviour in the context of relationship
and introducing human attachment styles.

The attachment system
---------------------

The Western culture views the ideal relationship as being between two self-sufficient people
who unite in a mature, respectful way while maintaining clear boundaries.

If, instead, you managed to develop a strong dependency on your partner, you are deficient in
some way and are advised to work on yourself to become more “differentiated” and develop a
“greater sense of self.” The worst thing that can possibly happen is that you end up needing
your partner, which is equated with “addiction” to him or her.

The researchers argue that the need to be near someone special is extremely important from
evolutionary standpoint. So that the brain has a biological mechanism specifically responsible
for creating and regulating our connection with our attachment figures -- parents, children,
and romantic partners).

This mechanism, called the attachment system, consists of emotions and behaviors that ensure
that we remain safe and protected by staying close to our loved ones. In prehistoric times,
being close to a partner was a matter of life and death, and our attachment system developed
to treat such proximity as an absolute necessity.

The mechanism explains why a child parted from his or her mother becomes frantic, searches
wildly, or cries uncontrollably until he or she reestablishes contact with her. These reactions
are known as protest behavior, and we all still exhibit them as grown-ups.


Attachment styles
-----------------

Attachment theory designates three main “attachment styles,” or manners in which people
perceive and respond to intimacy in romantic relationships, which parallel those found
in children: Secure, Anxious and Avoidant.

* secure people feel comfortable with intimacy and are usually warm and loving;
* anxious people crave intimacy, are often preoccupied with their relationships, and tend to
  worry about their partner’s ability to love them back
* avoidant people equate intimacy with a loss of independence and constantly try to minimize
  closeness.

One of the main messages of this theory is that in romantic situations, we are programmed to
act in a predetermined manner.

The attachment styles are not always compatible with each other.


The dependency paradox
----------------------

Once we choose a partner, there is no question about whether dependency exists or not. It
always does. An elegant coexistence that does not include uncomfortable feelings of vulnerability
and fear of loss sounds good but is not our biology. What proved through evolution to have a
strong survival advantage is a human couple becoming one physiological unit.

He or she is part of me, and I will do anything to save him or her; having such a vested interest
in the well-being of another person translates into a very important survival advantage for both
parties.

Does this mean that in order to be happy in a relationship we need to be sacrifice other aspects
of our life such as our careers or friends?

Paradoxically, the opposite is true! It turns out that the ability to step into the world on our
own often stems from the knowledge that there is someone beside us whom we can count on — and
this is the “dependency paradox.”

.. conclusion:

If this adult attachment theory holds, we should not worry about being dependent on our
partner. Rather, we'd better understand each other's attachment styles, take that into account
and strive to fulfill our biological role as a partner when navigating the dangerous waters
of love.

Thank you!
