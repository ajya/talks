Introduction to pyasn1

Handling ASN.1-based protocols in Python

 Track: Python devroom
 Room: UD2.120 (Chavanne)
 Day: Sunday
 Start: 16:30
 End: 17:00

The ASN.1 technology will be briefly explained followed by the introduction
to the pyasn1 package, its typical use cases and key features.

Many data formats and network protocols now days base on ASN.1. Python
developers sometimes encounter binary blobs of ASN.1 data structures which
they may want to analyze or modify anyhow.

Pythonistas who work with network protocols and data formats will hopefully
find this talk educational and inspiring. The key take away would be a general
understanding how pyasn1 can solve most of their ASN.1 needs, despite
seemingly bulky technology behind ASN.1.
