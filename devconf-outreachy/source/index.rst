Becoming OpenStack Developer via Outreachy
==========================================

Presented by: Aija JauntÄ“va, Dmitry Tantsur, Richard Pioso, Ilya Etingof

What is OpenStack
-----------------

* Decade-old open source community project
* Has involves XXX developers from YYY companies
* Made of XXX repos totalling YYY commits

What is Outreachy
-----------------

* Outreachy breeds new open source engineers
* Outreachy fights the discrimination
* Interns get on-board open source projects
* Each intern gets a mentor (or two)
* 3 month remote paid internship

Why enrolling into the internship
---------------------------------

* To find your aspirations
* To learn the software engineering craft
* To get along with the open source trade guild
* To get a job (hopefully, the dream one)

Why mentoring with @Outreachy
-----------------------------

* Sustain the open source culture
* OpenStack helps breeding open source engineers
* Diversity is healthy, discrimination is unfair

Aija's Internship @OpenStack
----------------------------

* How it all begun

  - finding a project

     - something new, but in familiar programming language
     - mentors in similar time zone

* The initial application:

  - Challenges

    - initial ticket
    - transparency of other applying

  - Successes

    - dedicated tickets for application

.. Things to talk about ^

  my background: a full-stack web developer in enterprise information systems
  using Java and C#. Used FOSS for personal needs.

  Criteria to filter initial list. Try something new that haven't done before.
  Best chances with projects in Python that have used in personal projects.

  Similar time zone to avoid waiting for hours if get stuck with something.
  If wouldn't be able to find the project using all criteria, this would be dropped.

  OpenStack project matching all criteria.

  Choice of the ticket was not successful - in the end it did not result in any code,
  but only documentation updates.
  Seemed that best tickets were already taken.

  Visibility of other people applying and how they are going. New applicant appearing
  after application deadline extended.

  Despite the challenges of initial ticket,
  dedicated tickets still a good starting point.

Outreachy application period
----------------------------

In the eyes of a mentor:

* Come up with isolated, yet non-trivial and useful tasks
* On-board a handful of candidates to let them proceed
* Pondering code reviews aiming to merge their work

OpenStack: everybody struggles
------------------------------

* Technology

  - Code complexity and its sheer size is overwhelming
  - The developer's workbench takes time to learn
  - Not always possible to run OpenStack at home

* Social

  - Code reviews tend to be slow
  - Sometimes feedback can look harsh
  - Newcomers are prone to taking the feedback personally
  - It takes time become a good community citizen

Aija's survival hints
---------------------

* Code reviews

  - Don't take it personally (really don't)
  - But take responsibility for the code you write
  - Essential part of programming
  - Opportunity to learn

* Asking questions

* Working from home/remotely

  - Self-starter
  - Motivation
  - Dedicated place to work
  - Video calls

.. Things to talk about ^

  Code reviews very demanding and questioning every single bit.

  "You are not your code" - aware not to take this personally.

  Avoiding opposite extreme - not taking responsibility for the code

  Important part of software development, still productive time if
  not writing new code actively.

  Learned and researched new things
  even if they did not make to submitted version.

  Finding a balance when to ask for help - is it too soon or should
  try to figure out yourself.

  Working outside the regular office might be challenging. Need to have
  right motivation and environment. Separate work form leisure and
  leisure from work.
  Regular calls for synchronous/instant communication.

Case study: reaching out for the industry
-----------------------------------------

How we helped to bringing down the silos between the manufacturers, standards body
and the open source community though the internship.

* Aija worked on a new protocol implementation for OpenStack/ironic which has not been fully standardized
* A couple of confusion points arose
* Aija has reached out for Dell - the hardware manufacturer implementing the same protocol on the hardweare side
* Dell engineers set up Aija with DMTF to clarify the technical matters
* Aija's experience has been fed back to the standards organization what:

  - Helped to clarify and improve the technicalities of the standard
  - Set up the ties between the computer manufacturer's engineers, OpenStack engineers and the standards organization
  - Taught Aija to negotiate intricate and complicated technical matters with fellow engineers
  - Proved that this internship has been successful

How to be a better mentor
-------------------------

Work-wise:

* Keep your intern busy, challenged and growing
* Help keeping them focused to get things done
* Build on small successes, plan and promote small steps

Community:

* Network interns with the upstream community
* Involve interns in code reviews

Psychologically:

* Understand the psychological setting, be aware of the biases
* Consider being a co-researcher with your intern, rather than a master-apprentice
* Promote friendliness, awesomeness and curiosity

Signs of a successful intern
----------------------------

Taking Outreachy internship takes time and effort. Does it make sense for you? It might be if you:

* Are heavily into the computers and coding for the sake of it
* Understand and tolerate the quirks of the open source community
* Have done your research and the project you are applying looks awesome to you
* Are hoping to stay involved with the project/community after the internship is over
