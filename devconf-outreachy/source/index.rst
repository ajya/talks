Becoming OpenStack Developer via Outreachy
==========================================

Presented by: Aija JauntÄ“va, Dmitry Tantsur, Richard Pioso, Ilya Etingof

Why we do this
--------------

* To help breeding software engineers
* Sustain the open source culture

.. Things to talk about ^

  Much like in medieval European trade guilds (or even now days science), software
  engineering seems to require some kind of apprenticeship before one can get a
  hold of the profession.

  As breeding and sustaining open source software is part of the Red Hat business
  strategy, attracting and growing open source engineers lines-up well with
  company's goals.

  Beyond that, we are the open source engineers ourselves. It is in our immediate
  interest to sustain and promote the culture we enjoy and being part of.

What is OpenStack
-----------------

* Decade-old open source community project
* Has involves 1025 developers from 126 companies
* Made of 728 repos

Reference: https://www.stackalytics.com, Stein cycle

.. Things to talk about ^

  OpenStack is a large and well-established, highly collaborative open source software
  engineering project. At OpenStack, we crave quality engineering practices, mutual respect
  and continuous learning.

  The goal of the OpenStack project is to create and maintain free and open source cloud
  management software.

  If we look at Stacklytics for the current (Stein) cycle, the basic stats can be seen on the
  slide.

About Outreachy
---------------

What is Outreachy:

  * Volunteer organization under Software Freedom Conservancy.
  * Brings together the interns, the mentors and the code
  * Promotes diversity and free software

How it works:

  * Interns get on-board open source projects
  * Each intern gets a mentor (or two)
  * 3 month paid internship

.. Things to talk about ^

  Outreachy is a volunteer organization operating under the Software Freedom
  Conservancy umbrella.

  Outreachy helps ends meeting: interns, mentors and the open source projects
  that seek contributors and mentors.

  The main focus of Outreachy is to promote and ensure diversity, getting
  different people from all over the world to join the open source bandwagon.

Why being an intern
-------------------

* To find your aspirations
* To learn the software engineering craft
* To get a job (hopefully, the dream one)

.. Things to talk about ^

  There might be many reasons for young people to consider Outureachy internship.

  Taking part in large-scale software development could help a person to understand
  if software engineering career would be a good fit for them.

  For the greenhorn engineers, being on the team with the masters of craft, works like
  an medieval apprenticeship and helps interns to grow.

  Finally, having worked on a highly-visible open source project helps building a
  digital trace to prove their worthiness to the prospective employers.

Why mentoring with @Outreachy
-----------------------------

* To contribute back to the culture we are part of
* Helps improve professionally and personally
* Get more hands on our stuff

.. Things to talk about ^

  One reason for being a mentor is to contribute back to the community which shaped
  us - the grown up programmers.

  We are the products of this culture, we need to sustain it to stay happy.

  Meeting new and diverse people help us to improve personally.

  Teaching can be quite rewarding - we learn new things, we explain them.

  Finally, Outreachy brings motivated and productive contributors to our projects.

Aija's Internship @OpenStack
----------------------------

* How it all begun

  - finding a project

     - something new, but in familiar programming language
     - mentors in similar time zone

* The initial application:

  - Challenges

    - initial ticket
    - transparency of other applying

  - Successes

    - dedicated tickets for application

.. Things to talk about ^

  my background: a full-stack web developer in enterprise information systems
  using Java and C#. Used FOSS for personal needs.

  Criteria to filter initial list. Try something new that haven't done before.
  Best chances with projects in Python that have used in personal projects.

  Similar time zone to avoid waiting for hours if get stuck with something.
  If wouldn't be able to find the project using all criteria, this would be dropped.

  OpenStack project matching all criteria.

  Choice of the ticket was not successful - in the end it did not result in any code,
  but only documentation updates.
  Seemed that best tickets were already taken.

  Visibility of other people applying and how they are going. New applicant appearing
  after application deadline extended.

  Despite the challenges of initial ticket,
  dedicated tickets still a good starting point.

Outreachy application period
----------------------------

In the eyes of a mentor:

* Come up with isolated, yet non-trivial and useful tasks
* On-board a handful of candidates to let them proceed
* Pondering code reviews aiming to merge their work

.. Things to talk about ^

OpenStack: everybody struggles
------------------------------

* Technology

  - Code complexity and its sheer size is overwhelming
  - The developer's workbench takes time to learn
  - Not always possible to run OpenStack at home

* Social

  - Code reviews tend to be slow
  - Sometimes feedback can look harsh
  - Newcomers are prone to taking the feedback personally
  - It takes time become a good community citizen

.. Things to talk about ^

Aija's survival hints
---------------------

* Code reviews

  - Don't take it personally (really don't)
  - But take responsibility for the code you write
  - Essential part of programming
  - Opportunity to learn

* Asking questions

* Working from home/remotely

  - Self-starter
  - Motivation
  - Dedicated place to work
  - Video calls

.. Things to talk about ^

  Code reviews very demanding and questioning every single bit.

  "You are not your code" - aware not to take this personally.

  Avoiding opposite extreme - not taking responsibility for the code

  Important part of software development, still productive time if
  not writing new code actively.

  Learned and researched new things
  even if they did not make to submitted version.

  Finding a balance when to ask for help - is it too soon or should
  try to figure out yourself.

  Working outside the regular office might be challenging. Need to have
  right motivation and environment. Separate work form leisure and
  leisure from work.
  Regular calls for synchronous/instant communication.

Case study: reaching out for the industry
-----------------------------------------

How we helped to bringing down the silos between the manufacturers, standards body
and the open source community though the internship.

* Aija worked on a new protocol implementation for OpenStack/ironic which has not been fully standardized
* A couple of confusion points arose
* Aija has reached out for Dell - the hardware manufacturer implementing the same protocol on the hardweare side
* Dell engineers set up Aija with DMTF to clarify the technical matters
* Aija's experience has been fed back to the standards organization what:

  - Helped to clarify and improve the technicalities of the standard
  - Set up the ties between the computer manufacturer's engineers, OpenStack engineers and the standards organization
  - Taught Aija to negotiate intricate and complicated technical matters with fellow engineers
  - Proved that this internship has been successful

How to be a better mentor
-------------------------

Work-wise:

* Keep your intern busy, challenged and growing
* Help keeping them focused to get things done
* Build on small successes, plan and promote small steps

Community:

* Network interns with the upstream community
* Involve interns in code reviews

Psychologically:

* Understand the psychological setting, be aware of the biases
* Consider being a co-researcher with your intern, rather than a master-apprentice
* Promote friendliness, awesomeness and curiosity

Signs of a successful intern
----------------------------

Taking Outreachy internship takes time and effort. Does it make sense for you? It might be if you:

* Are heavily into the computers and coding for the sake of it
* Understand and tolerate the quirks of the open source community
* Have done your research and the project you are applying looks awesome to you
* Are hoping to stay involved with the project/community after the internship is over
