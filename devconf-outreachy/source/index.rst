Becoming OpenStack Developer via Outreachy
==========================================

Presented by: Aija JauntÄ“va, Dmitry Tantsur, Richard Pioso, Ilya Etingof

What is OpenStack
-----------------

* Decade-old open source community project
* Has involves XXX developers from YYY companies
* Made of XXX repos totalling YYY commits

What is Outreachy
-----------------

* Outreachy breeds new open source engineers
* Outreachy fights the discrimination
* Interns get on-board open source projects
* Each intern gets a mentor (or two)
* 3 month remote paid internship

Why enrolling into the internship
---------------------------------

* To find your aspirations
* To learn the software engineering craft
* To get along with the open source trade guild
* To get a job (hopefully, the dream one)

Why mentoring with @Outreachy
-----------------------------

* Sustain the open source culture
* OpenStack helps breeding open source engineers
* Diversity is healthy, discrimination is unfair

Aija's Internship @OpenStack
----------------------------

* How it all begun

  - finding a project

     - something new, but in familiar programming language
     - mentors in similar time zone

* The initial application:

  - Challenges

    - transparancy of other applying

  - Successes

    - dedicated tickets for application

Outreachy application period
----------------------------

In the eyes of a mentor:

* Come up with isolated, yet non-trivial and useful tasks
* On-board a handful of candidates to let them proceed
* Pondering code reviews aiming to merge their work

OpenStack: everybody struggles
------------------------------

* Technology

  - Code complexity and its sheer size is overwhelming
  - The developer's workbench takes time to learn
  - Not always possible to run OpenStack at home

* Social

  - Code reviews tend to be slow
  - Sometimes feedback can look harsh
  - Newcomers are prone to taking the feedback personally
  - It takes time become a good community citizen

Aija's survival hints
---------------------

* Code reviews

  - Don't take it personally (really don't)
  - But take responsibility for the code you write
  - Oppurtunity to learn
  - "nit:"picks
  - Followup patches

* Working from home/remotely

  - Self-starter
  - Motivation
  - Video calls
  - Dedicated place to work

* Writing a blog
* Asking questions
* Using IRC

Case study: reaching out for the industry
-----------------------------------------

How we helped to bringing down the silos between the manufacturers, standards body
and the open source community though the internship.

* Aija worked on a new protocol implementation for OpenStack/ironic which has not been fully standardized
* A couple of confusion points arose
* Aija has reached out for Dell - the hardware manufacturer implementing the same protocol on the hardweare side
* Dell engineers set up Aija with DMTF to clarify the technical matters
* Aija's experience has been fed back to the standards organization what:

  - Helped to clarify and improve the technicalities of the standard
  - Set up the ties between the computer manufacturer's engineers, OpenStack engineers and the standards organization
  - Taught Aija to negotiate intricate and complicated technical matters with fellow engineers
  - Proved that this internship has been successful

How to be a better mentor
-------------------------

Work-wise:

* Keep your intern busy, challenged and growing
* Help keeping them focused to get things done
* Build on small successes, plan and promote small steps

Community:

* Network interns with the upstream community
* Involve interns in code reviews

Psychologically:

* Understand the psychological setting, be aware of the biases
* Consider being a co-researcher with your intern, rather than a master-apprentice
* Promote friendliness, awesomeness and curiosity

Signs of a successful intern
----------------------------

Taking Outreachy internship takes time and effort. Does it make sense for you? It might be if you:

* Are heavily into the computers and coding for the sake of it
* Understand and tolerate the quirks of the open source community
* Have done your research and the project you are applying looks awesome to you
* Are hoping to stay involved with the project/community after the internship is over
