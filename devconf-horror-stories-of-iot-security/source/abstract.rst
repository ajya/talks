IoT Security Horror Stories

In this talk, we'll explain what the Internet of Things (IoT) is,
explore the various forms it takes in today's world (e.g.
connected vehicles, unmanned aircrafts, or smart homes), and discuss
what the future of IoT might look like.

We'll briefly cover the technology behind IoT devices, ranging from
the ubiquitous teeny-tiny bits (e.g. chips, sensors, protocol stacks,
embedded operating systems) to data collection and analytics
happening in enormous foggy clouds.

Then we will outline the fundamentally distinct challenges that IoT
introduces to IT security, new threats that wild IoT adoption unleashes,
common types of attacks against IoT components, and approaches to their
mitigation. We'll align these observations with the analysis of
recently discovered real-world attacks of different scales and
ramifications.

The key takeaway of this talk is to raise the awareness among the
technically savvy public of the risks associated with the IoT
devices surrounding us. Additionally, the goal of this talk is also
to persuade engineers working on IoT projects to take security matters
seriously and adapt secure development practices in their workflow.
