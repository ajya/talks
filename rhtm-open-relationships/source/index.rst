Open relationships - new hype or future of the Mankind?
=======================================================

.. _opening:

There is a saying that goes like this:

“If you love somebody, set them free. If they come back to you, they are yours.
If they don't, they never were.”

Then why do people marry? Why otherwise free human beings impose formal, moral and
religious restrains on each other? One explanation is that it brings them an [arguably]
false sense of security...

Some people now days question the idea of the traditional family in form that we inherited
since, perhaps, the Old Testament. There are many ideas on how the relationships could
be done differently. Ultimately, they are all aiming at happier, fulfilling and more
secure relationships. The umbrella term for these experiments is known as open
relationships.

The decline of the marriage
---------------------------

The original family model of the stay-at-home wife and the husband as sole breadwinner began
to change during the Industrial Revolution in 19-th century. This tendency received additional
boost when women joined the workforce in record numbers during World War II.

The ultimate outcome was that women left behind their household to focused on the
career and education opportunities. That shifted gender roles and started to undermine the
existing marriage model.

Still, after the war, in 1950s, 96 percent of people of childbearing age were married.

The 1960s brought the sexual revolution - the underground culture questioning
the prevailing norms about sex and gender. They promoted sexual liberation and
"free love" over monogamy and marriage. Access to birth control pills and legalized
abortion were among the factors behind that movement.

In 1980s, marriage rates continued to drop. Part of the decline can probably be attributed
to the rise of another form of coupling: unmarried couples who lived together.

By 1990s, more LGBT people were coming out of the closet than ever before. They were living
together, raising children and fighting for their civil rights. Their appearance continued to
redefine the relationships and the family model.

In 2004, in about 50 years, the marriage rate had dropped nearly 50 percent.

Clearly, the structure and expectations of marriage are not as desirable or
functional as they were 50 years ago.

There's another significant indicator that traditional marriages and relationships aren't working:
cheating is epidemic.

The first statistics on the subject surfaced in 1953; it reported that 26 percent of wives and 50
percent of husbands had at least one affair by the time they turned 40 years old. The other polls
taken many times since then reveal more or less the same numbers.

Cheating on one's partner is a pivotal plot point in countless books, movies, plays, operas, songs.
It has become so widespread that it has created an entire industry of dating websites for cheaters
to meet other cheaters complemented by the private investigation services to hunt them down.

While nearly anyone might tell you that cheating is wrong and immoral, research reflects
quite different behavior. Having an affair has become a shadow institution: it's so ingrained in
our culture that we take it for granted as inevitable.

Why marriage is unstable
------------------------

One explanation is that marriage is based on the fairly tale assumption that a single
person will always be able to provide emotional, spiritual and sexual life-long support
to their partner.

Apparently, while this turns out to be possible, it is incredibly hard to achieve and sustain.

On top of that, those marriage assumptions are rarely discussed or negotiated
even when their violations cause distress and dramas.

Ironically, we tend to take less important things way more seriously. Take a contract with a cell
phone operator as an example -- it is frequently more detailed and explicit than the
rules and boundaries we desire and assume in our relationships.

Once a partner faces growing dissatisfaction for one reason or the other, their options
are limited. In response they can:

* become unhappy long-term by coping with it
* cheat and become unhappy from guild and betrayal
* break up and become unhappy from loss and grief

Well, the perspectives are not that attractive...

The open relationship
---------------------

In open relationship the idealistic assumption, which seems to be the basis of a marriage,
is replaced with a more realistic premise that one partner cannot always meet all
the needs.

So instead of hiding their dissatisfaction, they bring this fact out in the open. They
talk honestly about what they want, face their fears and the fears of others, and try to
figure out a way to pursue their desire without deception in ethical and responsible way.

In its most pure form, the open relationship is all about open and honest
communication, the negotiation between the partners. Open relationship does not
necessarily imply multiple partners at all.

People trying to open up their relationships in one way or the other face more
or less the same problems as people in the traditional family, though their
suffering may be more intense and overwhelming at least in the beginning.

The major struggle comes from within themselves. People reportedly confront powerful
and devastating emotions like jealousy, possessiveness, enviness, insecurity, fear
of being abandoned. A solution for them lies in building up their self-awareness,
self-worth and investing in their personal growth. The other important ingredient is
keeping the communication channel with their partner open to be able to work on the
problems together.

On one hand, people in open relationships seem to give up the comfort and security of
the marriage to expose themselves to their deepest fears.

But on the other hand, once they learn to value themselves and their freedom, as well
as the freedom of their partners, then comes the greater sense of security and
satisfaction.

.. conclusion:

We are programmers, thus in math we trust. The numbers shows us that the traditional
relationship model does not work well anymore.

But is there a better way? Will the open relationships eventually take over?
We are here to figure that out!

Thank you!
